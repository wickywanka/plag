Abstract. This paper presents a design of dual-band flexible wearable antenna for modern 5G 
applications to integrate on a smartwatch. This antenna is a rectangular antenna which the 
patch and the ground etched on new flexible material is called "ULTRALAM® 3850HT. This 
material is characterized by thin flexible cores with low and stable dielectric constant, which is 
a key requirement for high frequency and wearable designs. The dielectric constant  is equal 
r
to 3.14, and loss tangent tan is equal 0.005 of the ULTRALAM® 3850HT flexible material. 
The presented antenna is designed to operate at 38 GHz and 60 GHz. The SAR (specific 
absorption ratio) is also introduced and SAR results will be shown. The presented antenna with 
and without the smartwatch are simulated using HFSS and CST 2018. 
1. Introduction 
There are many problems that wireless communications in 4G such as frequency resources for their 
customers are not enough [1]. Therefore, the millimeter wave technology offers a new model of 
wireless communication in various fields including mobile devices, automobiles, military, medical and 
many more [2]. The mm-wave frequencies are the most suitable for broadband requirements in 
telecommunication systems that provide a frequency range in millimeter (20-300 GHz). Of these 
ranges, select four resonance frequencies of 26, 28, 38 and 60 GHz, where the antenna is required at 
these  frequencies  to  use  the  current  5G  spectrum  simultaneously  [3].  The  main  advantage  of 
millimeter wave technology is to reduce the volume of the devices because they have very high 
resonance frequencies and thus the smaller size of the antenna; also, high speed and high capacity [4]. 
There are also two bands of 5G technology other than the millimeter frequency band, the "5G low 
band" and the "5G average band" that use frequencies from 600 MHz to 6 GHz, especially 3.5-4.2

GHz [5]. But this paper interests only by the frequency band of millimeter wave technology for fifth-
generation applications. On the other hand, when any antenna attached or closed to the human body is 
called wearable antenna. The wearable antenna or antenna worn by the body radiates electromagnetic 
waves that are absorbed by human body tissues [6]. The absorption of these waves will cause damage 
and burn human tissues. It is, therefore, necessary to reduce the interaction of electromagnetic energy 
towards human body tissues from wearable antennas when used. Electromagnetic wave absorption is 
measured from human tissue at a specific absorption rate [7]. Besides, the SAR limit is based on the 
Standardization Committee and is varied in different regions around the world. In the United States 
regulated by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), where the maximum acceptable value 
of SAR 1.6 W / kg, with an average of more than 1 gram of tissue [8]. However; in Europe, the 
maximum  acceptable  SAR  2.0  W  /  kg  as  averaged  over  10  grams  of tissue  organized  by  the 
International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIPR) [8]. 
In this paper, the dual-band flexible wearable fifth-generation mm-wave antenna is designed and 
simulated to integrate it into a simulated smartwatch. The antenna design is a rectangular antenna 
included six U-slots on the patch. The patch and the ground plane etched on new flexible material as a 
substrate is called ULTRALAM® 3850HT. This antenna is designed to operate at two resonance 
frequencies 38 GHz and 60 GHz. The presented antenna is a body-worn antenna where its integrated 
into the smartwatch. So, the SAR (specific absorption ratio) value should be calculated for the 
presented design. Furthermore, the antenna and the smartwatch are simulated using two different 
techniques. These are HFSSTM from Ansoft which used FEM and CST STUDIO SUITETM 2018 
which used FIT. The two software packages are different; therefore the second has been used to 
confirm the results determined using the first. Also, good agreement is obtained between these results. 
2. Antenna Design 
Figure 1 shows the simulated geometry of the proposed dual-band rectangular millimeter-wave 
antenna. This proposed antenna includes six U-slots loaded on the top of the patch specially designed 
to achieve the dual-band concept with good impedance matching. The patch and the ground plane are 
rectangular and etched on the opposite sides of new flexible material is called "ULTRALAM® 
3850HT" as a substrate with very thin thickness h = 0.05 mm to achieve the flexibility for the 
wearable  antenna,  relative  permittivity    =  3.14  and  tan  ()  =  0.005.  Also,  this  material  is 
r
characterized by low and stable dielectric constant. The optimized dimensions are tabulated in Table 1.

3. Results and Discussion 
The  simulation  analysis  of  the  presented  antenna  is  carried  out  by  applying  differently  two 
commercial software packages are called HFSS from Ansoft and CST 2018 to confirm the results. The 
simulation of the return loss S11 for the proposed rectangular wearable antenna is shown in Figure 2. 
From the results obtained, this presented antenna is operated at two resonance frequencies 38GHz and 
60 GHz at the same time for 5G Applications. Also, there is a little shift between two results due to the 
two software packages are different where the HFSSTM from Ansoft used FEM and CST STUDIO 
SUITETM 2018 used FIT. The simulation results are mentioned in Table 2. Furthermore, the radiation 
pattern of the presented antenna in both planes: E-plane and H-plane are shown in Figure 3.

4. Smart Watch Design 
Nowadays, the field of smart wearable devices like smartwatches is growing rapidly and has 
attracted great attentions from publications and industries [9]. Generally, the wearable smartwatch 
antennas represent many challenges for a design engineer. It should be lightweight, flexible, small 
size, low profile and cost and also easy to integrate or carry by the human hand [10]. In this chapter, a 
smartwatch is designed, simulated and attached with a millimeter-wave antenna to operate on 5G 
wireless technologies.  Figure 4 illustrates the geometry of the watch with a practical size. This watch 
consists of two parts: the watch body and rubber straps. The dimensions and materials properties of 
the watch are tabulated in Table 3.

Next, the presented antenna above is integrated onto the designed watch to be smart. The antenna 
is placed near the main PCB board to obtain the required input power from the internal battery of the 
watch. The smartwatch with the proposed rectangular millimeter-wave antenna is shown in Figure 5a 
and the simulated return loss for the first proposed rectangular antenna with and without smartwatch is 
plotted in Figure 5b. From these results, there is a little shift in the return loss with the frequency; this 
is due to the presence of the smartwatch.

5. SAR Calculations 
It is important to make sure that the humans are exposed to less electromagnetic waves and the 
presented smartwatch is safe. For these reasons, the specific absorption ratio (SAR) is studied, which 
must be  satisfied the  international safety standards, FCC (SAR<1.6W/kg over 1g) and ICNIRP 
(SAR<2W/kg over 10g). Figure 6 illustrates the simulated SAR distribution for the smartwatch with 
the proposed millimeter-wave antenna and attached to the human hand model at two resonances 
frequencies 38, and 60 GHz. These results are mentioned in Table 4. From these results, notes that all 
the SAR values results do not exceed unity.

6. Conclusion 
In this paper, a flexible wearable dual-band antenna is analyzed and simulated for integration onto 
a simulated watch to make it smart for modern wireless 5G networks. This wearable antenna combines 
the hardness and flexibility in that one which is made of a material called ULTRALAM® 3850HT. 
This material is characterized by thin flexible cores with low and stable dielectric constant. This 
antenna is designed to operate at two resonance frequencies 38 GHz and 60 GHz. In this paper, the 
SAR value is very low, thus this smartwatch operated properly in the nearness of the human body. The 
presented antenna with the simulated smartwatch is simulated using HFSS and CST STUDIO SUITE 
2018.
