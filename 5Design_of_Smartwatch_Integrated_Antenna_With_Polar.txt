ABSTRACT A design of smartwatch integrated antenna with polarization diversity is proposed. An annular 
ring is integrated in the framework of smartwatch, and excited by two ports. One port is fed by a coplanar 
waveguide (CPW) line loaded with a T-shaped matching network, and the other is fed by a coplanar strip line 
(CPS). The overall model of the proposed antenna has a cylindrical shape with 38 mm diameter and 7.5 mm 
thickness. A metallic plate is located at the backside of the antenna to mimic the shell of smartwatch. The 
prototype is fabricated and measured, and the measured results agree well with the numerical ones. The two 
ports have orthometric radiation patterns and can cover the 2.4 GHz wireless local area network (WLAN) 
band. The gain of the antenna is higher than 3.2 dBi in free space. The proposed antenna is also analyzed 
with a cubic tissue model and a wrist model in different distances between the proposed antenna and human 
models. The performances on body scenarios are also acceptable. The values of specic absorption rate (SAR) 
in the cubic tissue model and wrist model are below the limitations set by both the Federal Communication 
Commission (FCC) and the European Telecommunication Standards Institute (ETSI). Envelope correlation 
coefficient  (ECC)  shows  proposed  antenna  can  be  used  in  multiple  input  multiple  output  (MIMO) 
applications. The influence of battery and printed circuits board assembly (PCBA) on S parameters is obvious, 
and gain and radiation efficiency are not much affected.

designs proposed the solutions of locating antennas and 
feeding ports on watch straps [18]-[20]. However, these 
designs were completely ingenious but not very practical due 
to the various deformations when worn on the users wrist 
and also the unrealizable feeding connection between the 
antennas on the belt and the RF circuits in the body of the 
watches. 
Antenna diversity technologies can significantly improve

dual-port antennas with polarization diversity and high port 
 
isolation [21]-[26]. However, due to their topologies and 
sizes,  these  designs  could  hardly  be  applied  to  real 
smartwatch and body scenarios. Most of these designs did 
not consider the integration between antenna and smartwatch, 
and the coupling between antenna and human tissue.  
We propose a design of smartwatch integrated antenna 
with polarization diversity for 2.4 GHz WLAN applications. 
The proposed antenna has a simple structure because smart 
watch antenna is generally limited by its structure, and the 
proposed antenna compared to the existing antennas realizes 
diversity technology, which has not been realized in the 
previous smart watch antenna. The initial design idea is that 
two ports excite the odd and even modes of a ring resonator   
respectively, which has been presented in our previous work  FIGURE 4.  The antenna in microwave chamber for measurement.

A.  ANTENNA DESIGN  
Fig. 1 shows the geometry of the proposed antenna. The 
overall model has three layers. The top layer and the bottom 
layer are both FR-4 circuit boards ( = 4.3, tan  = 0.02), and 
r
the antenna is located on the surface of the top FR-4 board. 
The middle layer is a foam board ( = 1.1) which is used to 
r
pad the antenna up. All the values of the geometry parameters 
are shown in Fig. 1 and TABLE 1. 
A split ring resonator plays the main body of the antenna 
[21], [27]. As shown in Fig. 1 (a), the antenna is composed of 
a T-shaped line and two metallic arcs. The T-shaped line for 
impedance matching is the extension of the inner signal line of 
  the feeding CPW (port 1). The two metallic arcs are connected 
FIGURE 5.  Geometry with the cubic tissue model.  to the two outer ground planes of the CPW, and the electric 
length of one arc is about a half wavelength at 2.4 GHz. There 
 
is an air bridge wire across the port 1, which connects the two 
outer ground planes of the CPW together, shown in Fig. 1 (b), 
thus  the  annular  ring  is  constructed.  The  annular  ring 
connected to a CPS is excited by the port 2 at the other side of 
the antenna. A circular metallic shell is located under the 
bottom FR-4 board to mimic the backed shell of smartwatch, 
called Ground. The design procedure: choosing appropriate 
values of h, R, r, r  can realize impedance matching of 
1
port 2. Then, designing the geometry of T-shaped line can 
realize impedance matching of port 1.

III. PERFORMANCES AND RESULTS 
The proposed antenna is fabricated and measured. The 
results of simulation and measurement are analyzed in free 
space, and with the cubic tissue model and wrist model. 
A. S PARAMETERS 
The S parameters in free space are shown in Fig. 7 (a). In 
free space, port 1 operating band (S  < -10 dB, VSWL < 2) is 
11
from 1.89 GHz to 2.93 GHz in simulation, and from 1.89 GHz 
to 2.62 GHz in measurement. The overlapped bandwidth in 
free space is 1040 MHz in simulation, and 730 MHz in 
measurement, which can cover the band for 2.4 GHz WLAN 
applications. Port 2 operating band is from 2.33 GHz to 2.50 
GHz in simulation, and from 2.31 GHz to 2.53 GHz in 
measurement. The overlapped bandwidth in free space is 170 
MHz in simulation, and 220 MHz in measurement, which can 
also cover the band for 2.4 GHz WLAN applications. In the 
band range of 2.4 GHz  2.5 GHz, the isolation between the 
 
two ports (S ) is lower than -13 dB in free space.

  parameters with the wrist model when d is 0.5mm and 2mm, 
and especially the measurement results. The operating bands 
of  both  ports  move  to  lower  frequency  because  of  the 
influence of human tissue, but they still cover 2.4 GHz WLAN 
bandwidth. The values of port isolation S  is lower than -12 
21
dB on body scenario on the band range of 2.4 GHz to 2.5 GHz.  
TABLE 3, TABLE 4 and TABLE 5 list all the values of 
operating band and bandwidth when antenna is in those three 
situations. When the antenna is put on the cubic model, its 
lowest bandwidth is 260 MHz when d is 0.5mm. When the 
antenna is put on the wrist model, the lowest bandwidth is 500 
MHz when d is 2mm. These two lowest bandwidths are both 
sufficient for smartwatch antenna at 2.4 GHz WLAN. As for 
comparison between simulated results and measurement, there 
is  little  difference  of  the  operating  band  between  the 
simulation and measurement both in free space and on the 
wrist model, as shown in TABLE 3 and TABLE 5. The 
simulated results and measurements can cover the 2.4 GHz 
WLAN band. TABLE 6 shows that operating band is not 
  much affected by the hand in measurement, because the ring

the battery and PCBA into the inner structure to analyze the 
influence of them.  
A. ECC 
ECC is a parameter to evaluate whether the antenna can be 
used  in  MIMO  applications.  It  can  be  calculated  by  S 
parameters [32] or by this formula in far field [33]: 
 
 
 = |4F1(,)*F2(,)d| (1)  FIGURE 12.  Antenna model after adding the battery and PCBA. 
12
 |F(,)|d |F (,)|d  
4 1 4 2  
The results of ECC at 2.4 GHz are shown in TABLE 11. It 
lists ECC calculated by simulated S parameters, measured S 
parameters, and measured ECC in far field. As we can see, the 
results are all low in free space. When antenna is with cubic 
tissue model or wrist model, the results of d = 0.5 mm and d 
=2 mm are also low. The maximum value in TABLE 11 is just 
1.368×10-2, which is enough low to be used in MIMO 
applications . 
B. INFLUENCE OF BATTERY AND PCBA 
Influences of the battery and PCBA (printed circuit board 
assembly) are studied. We replaced the foam board with a PEC 
and a lossy metal to mimic battery and PCBA, shown in the 
Fig. 12. The S parameters in free space are shown in Fig. 13. 
When the PCBA is not too close to the proposed antenna, the 
antenna  can  basically  maintain  the  impedance  matching. 
When the battery and PCBA are too large, the antenna needs   
to be redesigned. Gain and Radiation efficiency are listed in 
TABLE 12, which are not too much affected. 
V. CONCLUSION 
A  design  of  smartwatch  integrated  antenna  with 
polarization diversity is proposed. The annular shape and the 
size of the proposed antenna make it easy to be integrated in 
the frame of the normal smartwatch. The polarization diversity 
is realized by exciting the two ports. The antenna is also 
analyzed with cubic tissue model and wrist model when the d 
is 2 mm and 0.5 mm respectively. According to the simulation 
and measurement results, the band ranges can cover 2.4 GHz 
WLAN band. The peak gains are higher than 2 dBi of both 
ports in free space and on body scenarios. The port isolation 
S  is lower than -13 dB from 2.4 GHz to 2.5GHz, and the 
21
cross-polarization is below -10 dB. The radiation efficiency is 
higher than 32% on cubic tissue model at 2.4 GHz, which is 
 
sufficient for smartwatch application, and it is even higher 
than 62% on wrist model. Besides, the 10-g SAR values and  FIGURE 13.  S parameters with battery and PCBA in free space. (a) S11;

which are both less than the limitations set by FCC and ETSI.

performances are also acceptable. The low ECC results show 
the proposed antenna can be applied on MIMO applications.  REFERENCES
